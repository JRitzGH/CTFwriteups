# Hidden Cells: PWNme Qualifiers (Misc Challenge)t
## Given Description
My computer wanted to play sudoku, but it only knows binary.
It gave me a 16Ã—16 grid of 0s and 1s, and asked me to fill in the missing cells.
Apparently, the solution will help me unmask a secret.

Can you help me solve it? I was told I should pay close attention to the format of the flag.

Flag format: `PWNME{.........................}`
